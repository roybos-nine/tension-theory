Tension Theory proposes a single starting point:

The universe is not made of objects.
It is a self-referential function.

Information is not a stored token.
It is an active relational process that continuously abstracts and reorganizes itself under constraint.

From this, everything else follows.

When relations operate under constraint, tension appears.
When tension is reduced locally, stable correlations emerge.
Stable correlations compress into geometry.
Geometry is not fundamental — it is the most efficient persistent summary of relational structure.

Time is not a background parameter.
Time is the ordering produced by optimization.
It is the record of constraint resolution.

Quantum uncertainty corresponds to underconstrained relational states prior to stabilization.
Black holes correspond to extreme relational compression where outward propagation of structure is limited.

Consciousness is not separate from the system.
It is a local recursive loop of the same function observing and constraining itself.

The objective is not metaphor.
The objective is formalization.

If the model is wrong, it should fail mathematically.
If it is correct, it should produce testable differences from existing frameworks.

This is an open attempt to derive physics, geometry, and observers from a single principle:
Self-referential information optimizing under constraint.
